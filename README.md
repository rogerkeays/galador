# Galador: The World of Devastation

*Galador* is a Dungeons and Dragons campaign setting kick-started in 1991 by a bunch of nerdy primary school kids, and surviving until the end of their high school days. Now it has a home on github, so your kids can join in on the fun too.

## History

 * [Forgotten Legends of Galador](history/legends-of-galador.pdf?raw=true): A mysteriously unfinished record of the history of Galador supposedly written by the Eternal God Kalin, though due to the large number of spelling errors and poor style, it is usually attributed to a halfling or a kender. Possibly even Moonwick Lightfinger himself.

## City Maps

 * [Estramon](maps/cities/estramon.jpg?raw=true): the capital of Galador and home of the aging King Vallener.
 * [Delaware](maps/cities/delaware.jpg?raw=true): a thriving city in the province of Eleinoch surrounded by stunning cliffs.
 * [Elven City](maps/cities/elven-city.jpg?raw=true): a forest city with few constructed dwellings since the elves returned to living in the trees.
 * [Angerthas](maps/cities/angerthas.jpg?raw=true): a city of strategic military importance, being midway between human and elven settlements and protected on one side by The Bottomless Crevasse.
 * [The Caverns of Estramon](maps/cities/estramon-caverns.pdf?raw=true): the former dwelling of the Snake Men, now occupied by the Lizard Men, which is not a great improvement. Deeper in the caverns, other exiles have also found a home, though none dare to venture to the lowest levels where more than a few adventurers have met their end.

## Country Maps

 * [Galador](maps/countries/galador.1995.jpg?raw=true) ([1994](maps/countries/galador.1994.jpg?raw=true), [1991](maps/countries/galador.1991.jpg?raw=true)): the main continent where most of the action happens. Home to many different races in a constant state of struggle.
 * [Imnusa](maps/countries/imnusa.jpg?raw=true): home of the minotaurs, where the weak are quickly weeded out. Also a frequent source of problems for the denizens of Galador.
 * [Jrun](maps/countries/jrun.jpg?raw=true): a cold continent in the south waiting to be explored.
 * [Aldred](maps/countries/aldred.jpg?raw=true): a difficult to reach isolated continent somewhere in the Cold Sea. Those who find this place tend to stay, mostly because they can't get back.
 * [Axe Island](maps/countries/axe-island.jpg?raw=true): the home of the dwarves, where they sought refuge after the loss of their leader to the humans on their arrival to Galador.
 * [The World](maps/countries/world.jpg?raw=true): a kender's approximation of the known world. May also include figments of the map-maker's imagination.
